# todo-list-web

App to practise test driving a web application.

### Running the tests
`rspec` 
Some of these tests are failing and the idea is add unit tests and code to make the feature tests pass

### Running the app
`rackup`

### Steps

#### Step 1
Start with test driving a to do list model object. This object should be able to add and list to do items.

#### Step 2
Make the feature test pass for adding a new item via the browser. Your code will need to accept input from the browser 
and retrieve this input from the controller and pass it to the model 

#### Step 3
Add a feature test and unit test for being able to mark to do items as complete. Write code to make these tests pass.
